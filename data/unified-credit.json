                "note": " The total unified credit allowed as of 1987 is $192,800. The amount of the credit to be used in each period cannot exceed that period's tax liability, and so the credit may be gradually used up over a period of years. The unified credit is phased out once the amount of taxable gifts rises above a certain level."
