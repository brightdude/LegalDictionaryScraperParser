    "Social Security Disability Benefits (Ssdi)": {
        "definition": "SSDI benefits are payable to disabled individuals through the Social Security Administration. Many state workers' compensation statutes have specific provisions which dictate whether an injured employee may receive both workers' compensation benefits and SSDI benefits at the same time. Generally, if both benefits are appropriate for the same individual, a complex calculation will be performed to \"offset\" the benefits so that the individual does not receive more money than they are entitled to from both programs.",
