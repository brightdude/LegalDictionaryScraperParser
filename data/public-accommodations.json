    "Public Accommodations": {
        "definition": "Federal and state laws prohibit discrimination against certain protected groups in businesses and places that are considered \"public accommodations.\" The definition of a \"public accommodation\" may vary depending upon the law at issue (i.e. federal or state), and the type of discrimination involved (i.e. race discrimination or disability discrimination). Generally speaking, it may help to think of public accommodations as most (but not all) businesses or buildings that are open to (or offer services to) the general public.",
