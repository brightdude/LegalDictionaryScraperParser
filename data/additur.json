                "note": " The Supreme Court held inDimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474 (1935) that additur violates the Seventh Amendment and so is not permissible in federal courts. Many state courts allow additur, however, when the defendant agrees to the increased award on the condition that the court deny plaintiff's motion for a new trial."
