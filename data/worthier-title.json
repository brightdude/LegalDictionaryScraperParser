                "note": " The doctrine of worthier title today is usually considered in light of its implication for inter vivos transfers (that is, transfers made between living persons) to an heir. When a grantor makes an inter vivos conveyance of property followed by a future estate to his or her heirs, the conveyance is deemed to create a reversion in the grantor rather than a remainder, so that the heirs take by descent and receive a superior title than that which would have been received through the remainder."
