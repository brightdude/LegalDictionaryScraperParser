                "compares": "notice",
                "note": " If one party purchases a property and records the deed, a subsequent purchaser is normally held to know about it — to have “constructive notice” of it — as a matter of law since it is a matter of public record. Under a race-notice statute, however, a subsequent purchaser cannot have constructive notice of an unrecorded deed, and so the recorded deed has priority unless the purchaser actually knew about — had “actual notice” of — the unrecorded deed."
