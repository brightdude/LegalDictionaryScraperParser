        "definition": "See Poverty Guidelines. The Department of Health and Human Services publishes a list every year giving the lowest income acceptable for a family of a particular size so that the family does not live in poverty. Consular officers use these figures in immigrant visa cases to determine whether a sponsor's income is sufficient to support a new immigrant, in accordance with U.S. immigration laws. Visit the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Poverty Guidelines page for more information.",
