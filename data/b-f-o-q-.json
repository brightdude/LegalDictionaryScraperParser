    "B.F.O.Q.": {
        "definition": "Short for the phrase \"bona fide occupational qualification,\" in the employment discrimination context a B.F.O.Q. may absolve an employer from liability for discrimination when there is a legitimate reason to require, for example, that all of the employees working a particular job be of the same sex or age. The successful use of a B.F.O.Q. defense by an employer is rare in discrimination cases.",
