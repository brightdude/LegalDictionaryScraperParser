                "note": " Interrogatories are widely used as a discovery device in civil procedure and also have limited use in criminal proceedings. An interrogatory may be objected to and does not have to be answered if the court determines that it is excessive or burdensome. An interrogatory may also be submitted by a judge to a jury when the court asks for a general verdict and wants to know the basis of the decision, or when the court requires the jury to return a special verdict."
