                "note": " An insurance broker differs from an insurance agent in that a broker is usually considered an agent of the insured, even though he or she may receive a commission from an insurance company. A broker may sell the products of a number of insurers, and an insurer has no liability for a broker's wrongful actions (as misrepresentation or fraud). A securities broker often acts also as a dealer and so is often referred to as a broker-dealer."
