        "definition": "TTD benefits are available to employees whose injuries leave them totally unable to work for a period of time. The benefits are no longer payable when the \"temporary\" disability clears and the employee is able to resume working. In some states, if the employee must return to work at partial hours or at a wage loss while his disability resolves he may be entitled to payment of TPD benefits after receiving TTD benefits.",
