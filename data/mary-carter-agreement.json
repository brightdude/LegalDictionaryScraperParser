                "note": " In a Mary Carter agreement, the participating defendants agree to remain as parties to the lawsuit and guarantee payment to the plaintiff of a settled amount if no recovery is awarded against the other defendants. The plaintiff agrees to offset their liability by, or sometimes even to pay them from, a recovery awarded from the other defendants. Some states allow the admission of Mary Carter agreements into evidence. In other states they are illegal."
